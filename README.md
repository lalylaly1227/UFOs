# UFOs Challenge
By Gladys Robles

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Danaâ€™s webpage should provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. We needed to use various tools to get the job done and also format the page to make it aesthetically pleasing.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
With the updates to the site the user will be able to input items in any field and see the results immediately.  The table updates with each filter. Once you clear the filters, the entire dataset will reappear.

## Summary: In a summary, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
The formatting part was the most challenging for me and I was able to learn a lot in the process.  We can continue to enhance the page by adding pictures of the filtered items and other facts from additional data sources. Maybe add a scrapping button as well.
